This folder contains 24 CatS crystallographic structures for docking, in addition to a CSV file containing mappings between ligand IDs and structure IDs:
File CatS_ligandID_structureID.csv displays which ligand was crystallized with each structure ID.
Files in structure ID files are labeled by the following syntax: pdbid-CatS_chain#.pdb
All structure ID files were aligned to chain A of the gabj structure.
